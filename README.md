## Rhino Robots

[![Arduino Robot Control](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39977360/208218280-c486106f-3dde-4b0c-94fe-75af42436de9.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSTG7T9-4lo&feature=youtu.be)

Sandhu Machine Design Inc. of Champaign, Illinois produced a [series](http://www.theoldrobots.com/rhinoarm.html) of servo-controlled Rhino Robots in the 1980s. These robots were scaled down versions of their industrial counterparts (less expensive and less poweful). They were great for teaching and made their way into many instructional courses on robotics.

Today you may find them at government auctions, on eBay, or collecting dust in a closet at your local university's engineering lab.

## Software 

See [Rhino Arduino MM6](https://github.com/petermcd1010/rhino_arduino_mm6) for the robot control software running on the arduino.

Have fun!
